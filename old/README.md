# Gamehub
This site is the best of the best whenever it comes to unblocked games websites. It is entirely static, being able to be hosted on netlify, vercel, and render for absolutely free. It has emulators for the gamecube, n64, and ds built in. It even has a sister site (also static) that is able to cloak itself and the ultimate game hub such that neither one has been blocked to date: https://github.com/thepersonwiththestuff/Ultimate-Game-Hub-Redirect/tree/main

Welcome to the future
